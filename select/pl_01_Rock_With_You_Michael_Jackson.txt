Girl, close your eyes
let that Rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
there ain't nothing
that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine
You've gotta feel that beat
and we can ride the boogie
Share that beat alone
I wanna rock with you all night
Dance you into sun light
I wanna rock with you all night
Were gonna rock the night away
Out on the floor
there aint nobody there but us
Girl when you dance
there's a magic
that must be love
Just take it slow
cause we got so far to go
You've gotta feel that beat
and we can ride the boogie
Share that beat alone
I wanna rock with you all night
Dance you into sun light
I wanna rock with you all night
Were gonna rock the night away
And when the groove is
dead and gone
You know that love survives
so we can rock forever

all night sun light
all night rock the night away
I wanna rock with you all night
Dance you into sun light
I wanna rock with you all night
rock the night away
